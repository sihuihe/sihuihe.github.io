    <p>I like to explore new areas and take on new challenges. During my undergraduate years, I took classes from departments of physics,
        math, computer science, information engineering, as well as classes of history, poetry, music, drawing, psychology,
        and philosophy. Each area has a different thinking process while they are all in pursuit of understanding and appreciation.</p>
    <p>The exploration spirit also brought me to come across the Pacific ocean from China to US. I started my PhD in optics. 
        Interestingly, my research topic was liquid crystal-based biosensors for the detection of bile acids. This turned out to be mostly material science. </p>
    <p>I thought I would love to stay in academia. However, I happened to get an internship opportunity in Microsoft. 
        During the internship, I found that it was much more fun in the industry, and it was fun to go back to optics. 
        This led me to the world of Mixed Reality, which could 'teleport' you to anywhere. It is an exciting area as the next
        generation of display.
