    <p>I like to explore new areas and take on new challenges. During my undergraduate years, I took classes from departments of physics,
        math, computer science, information engineering, as well as classes of history, poetry, music, drawing, psychology,
        and philosophy. Each area has a different thinking process while they are all in pursuit of something
        beautiful.</p>
    <p>The exploration spirit also brought me to come across the Pacific ocean from China to US. This allowed me to explore the
        western culture and understand my own culture better. Hoping to explore the world deeper, I started my PhD in optics. 
        My PhD turned out to be related to both optics and material science. And my research topic was liquid crystal-based biosensors for the detection of bile acids.</p>
    <p>I thought I would love to stay in academia. However, I happened to get an internship opportunity in Microsoft. 
        During the internship, I found that it was much more fun in the industry. This also led me to the world of Mixed Reality. It is an exciting area as the next
        generation display. I learned a lot during my time in Microsoft and DigiLens, not just technical skills, but also soft skills. It is nice to be exposed to many different areas, 
        and learn from many people with different skill sets.
